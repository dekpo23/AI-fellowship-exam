Question 1
I created a basic calculator that performs addition, multiplication, subtraction and division.
The program initially requests users to input 2 numbers and an operation. The program then runs continously
until an exit flag is raised.

Question 2
I completed the code for a program that continously ask users for numbers and then returns if the number is even or odd. 

Question 3
I debugged a program that asks for a userâ€™s age repeatedly and say whether they are allowed to vote (18+). I converted to
integer first to avoid error
